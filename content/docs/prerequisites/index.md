OVM itself does not require any other software (aside from `tar` on Unix-based systems). However, due to some pecuiliarities currently affecting Odin releases, OVM builds all installs from source. This means that you need to have the required build tools and libraries installed in order to use OVM.

Please see [the requirements section](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/#requirements) of the Odin docs for a list of dependencies.
